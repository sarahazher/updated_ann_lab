    "# Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The objective of this Python program is to create a Perceptron Neural Network that can recognize whether a given number, represented in ASCII form (0 to 9), is even or odd. \n",
    "The program aims to demonstrate how a simple neural network model like the perceptron can be trained to perform binary classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Perceptron is a type of artificial neuron that takes multiple binary inputs and produces a single binary output. It works by calculating the weighted sum of its inputs and applying a step function to determine the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hereâ€™s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inputs: Each input represents a feature of the data. In this program, the input is the ASCII representation of a number, which is a sequence of binary digits (0s and 1s).\n",
    "# Weights: Each input is associated with a weight, which determines its importance in the calculation. These weights are initially set to zero.\n",
    "# Weighted Sum: The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated by multiplying each input by its corresponding weight and then summing up the results.\n",
    "# Activation Function: The weighted sum is then passed through an activation function. In this program, a step function is used. If the weighted sum is greater than or equal to zero, the output is 1; otherwise, it is 0.\n",
    "# Training: The perceptron is trained using a set of labeled data. It adjusts its weights based on the errors between the predicted outputs and the actual labels. This adjustment helps the perceptron to make more accurate predictions in the future.\n",
    "# Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perceptrons are simple yet powerful models that have various applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Some common applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pattern recognition: Perceptrons can be used to recognize patterns in data, such as handwritten digits, images, and text.\n",
    "# Binary classification: They are effective in binary classification tasks, such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and medical diagnosis.\n",
    "# Control systems: Perceptrons can be used in control systems to make decisions based on sensor inputs.\n",
    "# Robotics: They are used in robotics for tasks such as object detection, navigation, and path planning.\n",
    "# Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The algorithm for training a perceptron to recognize even and odd numbers can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize weights: Initialize the weights vector with zeros.\n",
    "# Define inputs and labels: Represent each number in ASCII form as a binary vector of length 7 (assuming ASCII representation of digits 0 to 9). Define labels for even and odd numbers.\n",
    "# Define the activation function: Define a step function that returns 1 if the weighted sum is greater than or equal to zero, otherwise returns 0.\n",
    "# Training loop: Iterate through the training data. For each example:\n",
    "# Calculate the weighted sum of the inputs.\n",
    "# Apply the activation function to get the predicted output.\n",
    "# Calculate the error between the predicted output and the actual label.\n",
    "# Update the weights based on the error.\n",
    "# Testing: Given a new input number in ASCII form, convert it to a binary vector. Calculate the weighted sum using the trained weights and apply the activation function. If the output is 0, classify the number as even; otherwise, classify it as odd.\n",
    "# This algorithm demonstrates how a perceptron can be trained to classify even and odd numbers based on their ASCII representation. With appropriate training data and tuning of parameters, \n",

    "# Perceptron:\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Perceptron is the simplest form of a neural network, mimicking the behavior of a single neuron. It receives multiple inputs, each multiplied by a weight, and produces a single output based on a threshold function. Mathematically, the output \n",
    "# ï¿½\n",
    "# y of a perceptron is determined by the weighted sum of inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#   are the corresponding weights.\n",
    "# ï¿½\n",
    "# b is the bias term.\n",
    "# The step_function is typically a threshold function that outputs 1 if the weighted sum is greater than or equal to zero, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "# Training a Perceptron:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The key to the Perceptron's functionality lies in its ability to learn from data. During training, the weights of the perceptron are adjusted iteratively to minimize the errors between the predicted outputs and the actual labels. This adjustment is typically done using the perceptron learning rule, which updates the weights based on the error:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#  .\n",
    "# By iteratively adjusting the weights using this rule and presenting the perceptron with labeled training examples, the model gradually learns to correctly classify the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Binary Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "# In the context of this program, the Perceptron is trained to perform binary classification, distinguishing between even and odd numbers. Each input instance (ASCII representation of a number) is associated with a label indicating whether the number is even or odd. The Perceptron learns to make this distinction by adjusting its weights based on the differences between its predictions and the true labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Representation of Numbers in ASCII Form:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The ASCII representation of numbers involves encoding each digit as a sequence of binary digits (0s and 1s). For example, the ASCII representation of the digit 0 is \"00110000\". Each binary digit in this representation serves as an input feature for the perceptron.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Role of Activation Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The activation function, typically a step function in a perceptron, introduces non-linearity to the model. It converts the weighted sum of inputs into a binary output, allowing the perceptron to make decisions based on thresholds. In this program, the step function ensures that the perceptron outputs 1 if the weighted sum is positive or zero, and 0 otherwise, effectively classifying numbers as even or odd.\n",
    "\n",
